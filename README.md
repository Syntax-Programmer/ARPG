I feel defeated, CAN'T SEEM TO GET IT, have spent 2 months figuring it out,
I think i am going insane.
So progress on this project is halted indefinetly.

I have tried 4 different approaches, maybe 3 rewrites, The first one was the only one that worked but was super unoptimized. In this race of optimizations I have lost.

I just wanted to shift to using best practices using textures, sliding window approach in an array instead of a doublly linked list array and using rects to render tiles

The results i got was super sad, the approach that i spent weeks stressing over even gave worse perfromace than the one which took more steps and mem

nothing works as the steps i have to take seem unavoidable but they hurt performance
